br_elect

Alternative democracy indicator capturing degree of multi-party competition. (0: No elections; 1:
Single-party elections; 2: Non-democratic multi-party elections; 3: Democratic elections).

coups, and political institutions. Review of International Organizations, 15 (2), 531–551

------------------------------------

ht_region

This is a tenfold politico-geographic classification of world regions, based on a mixture of two considerations:
geographical proximity (with the partial exception of category 5 below) and demarcation
by area specialists having contributed to a regional understanding of democratization. The categories
are as follow:
1. Eastern Europe and post Soviet Union (including Central Asia)
2. Latin America (including Cuba, Haiti & the Dominican Republic)
3. North Africa & the Middle East (including Israel, Turkey & Cyprus)
4. Sub-Saharan Africa
5. Western Europe and North America (including Australia & New Zealand)
6. East Asia (including Japan & Mongolia)
7. South-East Asia
8. South Asia
9. The Pacific (excluding Australia & New Zealand)
10. The Caribbean (including Belize, Guyana & Suriname, but excluding Cuba, Haiti & the Dominican
Republic)

act_act

A binary measure of whether a country has an accountable climate target (ACT) or not. An
ACT is a precise emissions target for which other countries can hold a country - and only that
country - accountable. A country has an ACT if it fulfills two criteria: 1) the country’s nationally
determined contribution (NDC) must state an economy-wide target in reference to emission levels
from a past year, a target compared to the business-as-usual scenario, or a target in terms of
the CO2 emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP); 2) the commitment must not be
conditional upon receiving financial support from third parties. The measure is for 2015, at the
time of the first NDCs.

targets”. Sustainability. 11. 7

cement. They include carbon dioxide produced during consumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels
and gas flaring.

epi_cda

The CO2 (carbon dioxide) growth rate, which makes up 55% of the Climate Change Issue Category,
is calculated as the average annual rate of increase or decrease in raw carbon dioxide emissions over
the years 2008-2017. It is then adjusted for economic trends to isolate change due to policy rather
than economic fluctuation.

epi_msw

Controlled solid waste refers to the proportion of household and commercial waste generated in
a country that is collected and treated in a manner that controls environmental risks. This metric
counts waste as controlled if it is treated through recycling, composting, anaerobic digestion,
incineration, or disposed of in a sanitary landfill.
